# My Resume Milestone Project 1 - Humberto Ragazzini

Welcome to "my resume", this website was designed with the purpose of being able to communicate to people who are interested in hiring me, either for a particular project or to work as a full-time employee, for this reason I was added to the website a page where you can fill in a very simple form to be able to contact me.



In order to access the website and visit it, you can do it by the following github link: [My Resume Project](https://humbertoragazzini.github.io/ms-1-front-end/)

# UX

## Strategy


### I divided the strategy into simple points that I am going to name below:

* **My idea**: A website where that person or company who is looking for a web developer can find my information in a simple and organized way.

* **Show Skill in The First Visit**: I would like that when entering for the first time, that person or company is able to see my skills as a web programmer or as a person, without having to name them explicitly.

* **My goal**: Taking aside the obviousness of finding a company or a person who needs my services, the main goal of my website is to be able to provide that person not only with a view of my skills, my work history or studies, but also They can see what the projects I did, what I am doing, or what I am going to do in the future.

* **Users Goal**: To be able to see what my skills are, what kind or style of web programmer I am, download my CV if he needs it, but mainly to be able to have an overview of me as a web developer and in this way be able to make the decision to contact me or not.

## Scope

In my strategy one of the points was to show with the first visit that I am capable as a web developer, and that access to information is fast and organized, the following feactures that are limited to my knowledge:

* **The main feactures**: the possibility of navigating between the following options to find as quick as possible the information needed:
    * An overview where you can see my main data (personal information) and the more general skills
    * A summary about the places where I work as well as where I studied)
    * A list in more detail my skills and the progress of each of them
    * A way to contact me either for a project or for a job opportunity

* **Full mobile device compatibility**: The inclusion of being able to navigate the site from any device, and that accessing from a mobile is not a limitation

* **Tiles**: for the presentation of more organized information the inclusion of tiles, where each one will have a role within the page.

* **Desired functions for the future**: 
    * A section with the portfolio of all the projects where I play a role.
    * Add the possibility to recive all the contact request to a whatsapp account (for quicker respond)
    * Implement multi-language options
    * Implement High Contrast theme, and Dark theme in the web site.
    * A data base with all the contacts with the possibility to filter and organize by type (remote or not), place (can be by country, state or city), time(when the contact take place), Why (a project, job).


## Structure

In this section I am going to outline the basic structure, and how I am going to present all the information.

* **What a visiter would like to see the first time**:
    * How i am? 
    * Personal details
    * skills
    * How to contact me?

* **How i present this information**: yo pense que la mejor manera de presentar toda esta informacion es en grupos.
    * The main group will be our tabs, home, my story, about me and contact.
    * The secundary group will be the tiles (squares with information in it), this tiles will show more specific information about, skills, activities, studies.
        * **Home**:
            * _Personal information_: Here will be showing thing such like Full Name, Phone, Email and a profile picture.

            * _Recent Activities_: This tile will be a list of the lastest activities, such a studies, progress of a project, new adquired skills, etc.
        * **My Story**:
            * _My work history_: Basically its a time line of the different jobs ordered by date
            * _My Studie history_: Like the work history this will be a time line with every single studie done by dates.
        * **About Me**:
            * _Coding Skills_: Inside of this tile are the different coding skills with the level of each one by porcentage.
            * _Others Skills_:  Although this is a webdeveloper resume, in this tile is for others skills which are not directly connected with a web developer job, but can be helpful.
